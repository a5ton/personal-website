    description: 'I worked on the Motorverse Garage frontend â€” a real-time 3D browser experience where users connect their wallets to view and interact with their NFT cars. Our team implemented Three.js to create a garage that supports multi-car rendering and dynamic metadata displays, including ownership history and traits pulled directly from the blockchain. The platform integrates wallet authentication and NFT APIs, offering users a seamless way to showcase and explore their digital vehicle collections. Designed with exceptional responsiveness across devices, the garage plays a key role in bringing on-chain assets to life in an interactive, visually rich environment.'

    description: 'The Factory Driver Program is a contributor platform our team developed for Straight4 Studios, creators of the upcoming sim racing title Project Motor Racing. As part of the development team, I helped build a platform that provides select sim racers with early access to in-development builds and a streamlined way to submit structured feedback. We implemented secure onboarding, gated build access, and AI-powered analysis that summarizes feedback and surfaces key themes. Our no-code approach in Bubble.io enabled rapid iteration, allowing us to deliver a polished, efficient experience for both testers and the development team.'
